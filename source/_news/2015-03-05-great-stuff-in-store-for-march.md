title: Great stuff in store for March
---

Oh boi, what a lineup! Can't wait until **March 19th** to visit 
[Mama, Preradoviceva 18](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Preradoviceva+18,+Zagreb,+Croatia/@45.810158,15.974297,17z) 
and listen to these guys and what they have to say.

First up, how to create elite jedi order of developers and to ensure that the quality of every project, 
task or bugfix will be on a desired level. [Slaven Vincetić](https://twitter.com/st00net) from 
[Degordian](http://www.degordian.com/) will share his tips and tricks for handling junior developers and encouraging 
senior developers to contribute with their experience. All that, packed in a talk, with lots of references to Star Wars.

Slaven worked with many Italian startups where he played with handful of technologies (elastic search, knockoutjs, 
gearman) but at the same time noticed a lot of bad development practices and even worse business processes. He gets to
use what he learned the hard way in Degordian and escape into development every now and then.

After the break, [Marin Crnković](http://blog.anorgan.com/) from [web.burza](http://web.burza.hr/) will 
introduce us to [SaltStack](http://saltstack.com/) - provisioning system that looks to stir some fun in field 
traditionally owned by [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/), [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/) and 
[Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home). Enter SaltStack, the remote execution, configuration management system 
that uses YAML files (psst, they are in fact Twig!). This talk will provide a crash course on the basics of Salt 
with some examples and use cases and to get you from "I install my software by hand" to "I used to install by hand, 
but now I love my life".

Marin is a passionate web developer, lover of all things pre-alpha, tinkerer, father of two, husband of one, 
living in Zagreb.
