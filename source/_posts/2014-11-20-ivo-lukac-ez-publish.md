2 years ago eZ Systems started to completely refactor its flagship product eZ Publish. One of the core decisions was to use Symfony2 framework as a baseline for generic parts and be backwards compatible in the transition period. We are still in the transition period but we see the light at the end of tunnel. Almost all core parts are now reimplemented with many improvements adopted along the way. Version 5.4 will be excellent choice for building complex content oriented web projects due to its immense flexibility. And we at Netgen have contributed to this transition a lot. Learn how.
